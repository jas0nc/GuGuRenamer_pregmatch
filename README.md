# GuGuRenamer_pregmatch
This GuGuRenamer use prematch to replace the need of Dictionary

This is a second version of gugurenamer.

But it use pregmatch to rename instead of dictionary.

The way to use this GuGurenamer_pregmatch is basically the same.

Currently support the below filename format renaming:
" - XX"  => " EXX "

"[XX]"  => " EXX "

" SXX "  => " SXX"

" XX] "  => " SXX"

"_XX] "  => " SXX"

" II] "  => " S02"

" III] "  => " S03"

(Please suggest if you find any new format needed to be rename)
